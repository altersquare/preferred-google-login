# Store listing assets

Chrome Web Store images for **Preferred Account Login**, generated from the
real popup UI so the listing accurately represents the shipping product.

## Regenerating

```bash
python store-assets/build.py
```

Requires Chrome (auto-detected on Windows, or set `CHROME`) and Pillow. The
script renders each page with headless Chrome at 2x, downsamples with LANCZOS,
and flattens to 24-bit RGB PNG — the store rejects PNGs with an alpha channel.

Screenshots embed `src/popup.html` + `popup.css` + `popup.js` in an iframe with
a stubbed `chrome.*` API supplying sample rules, so they update automatically
whenever the popup changes. Intermediate HTML is written to `_src/`
(gitignored); only the PNGs and `build.py` are tracked.

## Branding constraints

The v7.3.0 listing was rejected three times under "Spam and Placement in the
Store", with the Google branding guidelines cited. These assets deliberately
avoid the triggers:

- No Google logo or four-colour "G" anywhere, in the popup or in the images.
  The popup heading uses the extension's own icon (`icons/icon.svg`).
- No Google trademark in the extension name or in any baked-in promo text.
  The tagline is "The right account for every service. Automatically."
- No "Google Sans"; the popup uses a neutral system font stack.

Google service hostnames (`mail.google.com`, `drive.google.com`, ...) do appear
inside the screenshotted UI. That is accurate, factual product behaviour rather
than branding, and is what the extension actually configures.
